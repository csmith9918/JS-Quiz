<!--
This program asks a series of question and evaluates each answer.
The program keeps track of the number of questions guessed correctly
and displays that number to the user. It also displays the number
of questions the player got wrong.

Uses a two dimensional array to hold the questions and the answers.
Each element of the array represents one question and is itself
an array composed of two elements, the question and the answer.

Also uses a loop to cycle through the quesitons. Askss the questions and 
compares the response from the player to the ansnwers in the array. 

We use the prompt to ask the question and a conditional statement to see if the
answer was guessed correctly.
